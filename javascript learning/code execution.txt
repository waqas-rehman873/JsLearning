js have two phses 
memory and code 
n=2;
function fun(n){
    return n+1;
}
fun(n);
fun(4);
in this first will run the code  the assign memory undefined to it 
like  
'n=undefinded
fun {..}
fun: undefined 
then second phase is code execution phase it assign 
n=2;
function fun(2){
    return 2+1;
}
when return the value function execution will be delete 
and when whole program  done the whole execution delete 
/this will manage the whole process by call stack
in bottom of stack is global execution box or block
execution 1 when done it will popout it    and put in next ex2 
and after whole program exe then global will also delete
it all maintain order  of exe contexts
