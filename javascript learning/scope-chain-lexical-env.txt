lexical environment
 is a data structure that store  variables and functions     it allows interpreter to recognise 
which element and functions are accessible at different scopes within program  
function f1(){
     f2();
    var s=12;
    function f2(){
        console.log(s);
    }
}
f1().f2(); 
whole lexical environments are making a chain are called scope chain
 f2(holds  local var and funcs f1-parent )
